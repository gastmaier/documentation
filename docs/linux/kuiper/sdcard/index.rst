This section explains how you should go about formatting and flashing the SD
card with the software required to use many of platforms Analog Devices
supports.
There are several steps that need to be completed before your SD Card will be
ready to use.

Download the file
+++++++++++++++++

Download the relevant SD card image file from the :ref:`kuiper` page. Please
get the latest if you can. This can be done with wget as well:

.. shell::

   $time wget \
   $  https://swdownloads.analog.com/cse/kuiper/image_2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.zip

Yeah, it takes an hour (or more if your connection is slow).
At least you can drive down to your favourite coffee store, and indulge yourself.

Verify the download
+++++++++++++++++++

#. Check the md5, to make sure you have the right file.

   .. shell::

      $md5sum image_2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.zip
       279097240dec7156ff5e15b7ce0b8a25 image_2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.zip

#. A ``zip`` file is a compressed file, you need to uncompress it, and check the
   md5sum on resulted file:

   .. shell::

      $time unzip image_2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.zip real
       1m17.40s user 74.44s sys 2.11s

#. Again, check the results:

   .. shell::

      $md5sum 2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.img
       b160453396e482234094a92134769ec6 2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.img

Writing SD Card GUI
+++++++++++++++++++

.. warning::

   This will overwrite your entire SD card completely.
   Backup anything from the card you want to keep.

It is recommended to use `Etcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`__ to write to
your SD card but other options exist. Only the process for Etcher is covered
here.

Insert your target SD card and launch Etcher. With Etcher:

#. Select write image from file
#. Select the **.img** file that you have already extracted
#. Select the SD card that you inserted
#. Click flash
#. Wait for the card to be flashed and verified

.. image:: etcher.png

At this point the SD card is still not bootable,
follow the topics after :ref:`kuiper imaging sdcard`.

Writing SD Card Command Line
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning::

   This will overwrite your entire SD card completely.
   Backup anything from the card you want to keep.

Now that everything looks OK, write the file to your SD Card.

This will depend on your system, where your SD card installed itself. You also
need to do this as root, since normal users shouldn't be able to randomly write
files to block devices.

#. plug the SD Card into your SD-Writer. If this mounts the device (which many
   Linux distributions do), it is important that you unmount
   it.

   :code:`sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1`
#. Write the file (input file or ``if``) to the storage device (output file or
   ``of``).

   .. shell::

      $time sudo dd \
      $     bs=4194304 \
      $     status=progress \
      $     of=/dev/mmcblk0 \
      $     if=2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.img
       [sudo] password for user:

   Now, you have that slice of pizza that you got too... :)

This section explains how you should go about formatting and flashing the SD
card with the software required to use many of platforms Analog Devices
supports. There are several steps that need to be completed before your SD Card
will be ready to use.


#. Ensure the output buffers are flushed:

   .. shell::

      $sync

#. Unplug the SD card from your PC.

Verify
++++++

Since it's possible that the write process of a disk image can have some issues
(if the target had a sector marked as bad, dd will not notice, and write on top
of it), the safest thing to do is to run a
`file system consistency check <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fsck>`__ on things.
If you are unsure of how to use this tool, check the
`man page <http://linux.die.net/man/8/fsck>`__.

.. important::

   Most Linux kernels will need to have a physical eject between the steps
   above, and the steps below.

#. Unmount the file systems (fsck will not work on a mounted file system)

   .. shell::

      $sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1
      $sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p2

   If it fails with a
   ``umount: /dev/mmcblk0p2: not mounted`` error, that's OK.
   If it fails with a
   ``umount: /dev/mmcblk0p2: not found`` error, that means you have no disk
   inserted, or did a typo in the path.

#. Perform the file system consistency check:

   .. shell::

      $sudo fsck -y /dev/mmcblk0p1
       fsck from util-linux 2.20.1
       dosfsck 3.0.13, 30 Jun 2012, FAT32, LFN
       /dev/mmcblk0p1: 158 files, 76420/130812 clusters
      $sudo fsck -y /dev/mmcblk0p2
       fsck from util-linux 2.20.1
       e2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)
       /dev/mmcblk0p2: clean, 157918/452480 files, 717760/1808128 blocks

At this point the SD card is still not bootable,
follow the topics after :ref:`kuiper imaging sdcard`.

.. _kuiper sdcard windows:

From Windows hosts
------------------

This section explains how you should go about formatting and flashing the SD
card with the software required to use many of platforms Analog Devices
supports.
There are several steps that need to be completed before your SD Card will be
ready to use.

#. Download the compressed software image file
#. Extract the software image file
#. Connect the SD Card to the computer
#. Verify the software image file (Optional)
#. Format the SD Card (Optional)
#. Flash the SD Card

Download the SD Card File
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Download the software image file you want to write onto your SD Card. Typically
this is going to be the standard :ref:`kuiper`, but in some
instances specialized pre-compiled images are created for projects that are not
yet included on the standard image. So be sure you have the correct file.

-  Save the .Zip file or .Xz file to your local hard drive, and remember the
   file location.

Extract the Software Image File
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This step will decompress the large software image file you downloaded. Ensure
you have a decompression utility installed on your computer, capable of
extracting
`.Zip file format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)>`__
or
`.Xz file format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz>`__ such as
`7-Zip <http://www.7-zip.org/>`__

- Extract the software image file to a known location on your computer.

.. image:: 7zip.png
   :width: 400px

Connect the SD Card to the Computer
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Connect the SD Card to either an internal or external SD Card reader which is
connected to your computer. Most newer computers have an SD Card reader, but
there are plenty of USB connectable SD Card reader devices available.

Verify the Download (Optional)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This step is used to validate that the image you downloaded. Ensuring that it is
the version is correct and that the software wasn't corrupted during download.

Ensure you have the following application installed on your computer:
`WinMD5 <http://www.winmd5.com/>`__.

#. Open up WinMD5 application on your computer.
#. Browse to the extracted file location.
#. Check the m5dsum of the resulting file.

.. image:: winmd5free.png
   :width: 400px

Format the SD Card (Optional)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This step should be used if the SD Card format is unknown or needs to be
reconfigured.

Using SD Card Formatter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure you have the following application installed on your computer:
`SD Card Formatter <https://www.sdcardformatter.com/>`__.

Open the SD Card Formatter application on your computer, and set the following
fields:

#. **Select Card** = SD Card drive you want to format (usually says "boot" or
   "volume")
#. **Card Information** = Make sure the disc size approximately matches your SD
   Card capacity
#. **Formatting Options** = Select Quick Format

   .. image:: sd_card_formatter_gui.png
      :width: 400px

#. Once set, click the **Format** button
#. The program will notify you that the formatting is complete.(could take
   several minutes)

   .. image:: sd_card_format_success.png
      :width: 400px

Using DISKPART via Windows command prompt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows command prompt has **DISKPART** that is also capable of reformatting SD
cards and other drives.

#. Run Windows command prompt as administrator.
#. Type ``list disk``. All current dives will be shown.
#. Type ``select disk X`` where X is the SD card drive number. (Do not mistake
   this part)
#. Type ``clean`` to clean the drive. If an error occurs simply retry typing
   ``clean``.
#. Type ``create partition primary``.
#. Type ``format fs=FAT32``. The formatting may take 45 minutes or so. FAT32 is
   the tested file system type.
#. After the progress is at 100%, type ``assign`` to finalize the drive letter
   for Windows.

Flash the SD Card
+++++++++++++++++

This step will physically write the software image file onto the SD Card so it
will be ready for use.

There are several Windows applications that can flash SD Cards, we will describe
how to do it using two common tools. Ensure you have at least one of the
following tools installed on your computer:

`Win32DiskImager from Sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download?source=navbar>`__
or
`Etcher from Sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/etcher.mirror/>`__.

.. important::

   If you are unsure, or don't understand these directions - STOP.
   If you are not careful, you could accidentally write a Linux image to your
   PC hard drive.
   Your PC will not function properly after this, and your IT department should
   not blame ADI.

Win32DiskImager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Open up the Win32DiskImager application on your PC

   .. image:: sd_card_flash_gui.png
      :width: 400px

#. Using the small folder button in the **Image File** section, navigate to the
   location of your software image file you want to flash and select
   it.

   .. image:: sd_card_flash_file_select.png
      :width: 400px

#. Double check that the **Device** location in the upper-right corner, matches
   the SD Card drive location.

   .. attention::

      You DO NOT want to accidentally re-image your hard drive, so this step is
      critical to ensure you are flashing the SD Card and not anything else.

#. When you are ready to flash the SD Card, click on the "Write" button.
#. Win32DiskImager will also alert you to make sure you want to write to this
   drive, acting as another failsafe so that you don't accidentally image the
   wrong drive.

   .. image:: sd_card_flash_write_confirm.png
      :width: 400px

#. Flashing the image to the SD Card typically take 10-15 minutes, but a
   progress bar is provided during the process. So grab yourself a coffee.
#. "Write Successful" will appear when the program is finished, letting you know
   the SD Card is ready.

   .. image:: sd_card_flash_success.png
      :width: 400px

#. Exit the Win32DiskImager program, and use the Windows "safely remove
   hardware" function to eject the disk, before physically removing the SD card
   from the reader.

Etcher
~~~~~~

#. Open Balena Etcher and select the .img file you want to write to the SD
   card.

   .. image:: etcher_start.png
      :width: 400px

   .. image:: etcher_file_select.png
      :width: 400px

#. Select the drive you want to write your image to.(should display as an SD
   Card)

   .. image:: etcher_disk_select.png
      :width: 400px

   .. image:: etcher_disk_selection.png
      :width: 400px

#. Review your selections and click 'Flash!' to begin writing data to the SD
   card.

   .. image:: etcher_sd_card_selected.png
      :width: 400px

   .. image:: etcher_flashing_sd_card.png
      :width: 400px

#. After flashing, Etcher will automatically validate the image flash correctly.
   You can either wait for this to finish or click skip.

   .. image:: etcher_verifying.png
      :width: 400px

#. After the validation is complete, your SD card is finished and ready for
   use.

   .. image:: etcher_finished.png
      :width: 400px

#. Go to the toolbar of your Windows OS, and click on "safely remove hardware",
   and remove your completed SD card.
